Title: Cryptographic Hash, Extendable-Output and Base64 Functions
Version: 1.0.4
Description: Fast and memory-efficient streaming hash functions and base64 encoding / decoding. Hashes strings and raw vectors directly. Stream hashes files which can be larger than memory, as well as in-memory objects through R's serialization mechanism. Implementations include the SHA-256, SHA-3 and 'Keccak' cryptographic hash functions, SHAKE256 extendable-output function (XOF), and 'SipHash' pseudo-random function.
