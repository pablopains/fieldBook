Description: Spell checking common document formats including latex, markdown, manual pages, and description files. Includes utilities to automate checking of documentation and  vignettes as a unit test during 'R CMD check'. Both British and American English are  supported out of the box and other languages can be added. In addition, packages may define a 'wordlist' to allow custom terminology without having to abuse punctuation.
